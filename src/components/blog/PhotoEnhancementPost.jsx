          What Exactly is AI Photo Enhancement?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          AI photo enhancement uses complex algorithms and machine learning models trained on millions of images. These AI systems have learned to understand what makes a photo "good" â€“ what sharp details, balanced colors, and proper lighting look like. They use this knowledge to intelligently fix imperfections in your photos automatically.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">Common enhancement tasks include:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4 pl-5">
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Upscaling:</strong> Increasing the resolution and detail of a low-resolution image without making it look pixelated.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Denoising:</strong> Removing digital "noise" and grain from photos taken in low light.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Sharpening & Deblurring:</strong> Correcting slight motion blur or focus issues to make details crisp.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Color & Light Correction:</strong> Automatically adjusting brightness, contrast, and color balance for a more vibrant look.
