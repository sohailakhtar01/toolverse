          How to Use AI in Excel: Free & Built-in Features
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          You don't always need expensive software to start. Here are some ways to **use AI in Excel for free** or with readily available tools:
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">
          1. Excel's Built-in "Analyze Data" (formerly "Ideas") Feature:
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Modern versions of Microsoft Excel (Microsoft 365) include an "Analyze Data" feature (found under the "Home" tab). Simply select your data, click "Analyze Data," and Excel's AI will automatically suggest charts, pivot tables, and trend analyses that could be relevant. It's an excellent, free starting point for quick insights.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">
          2. Leveraging AI Chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) for Formulas and Logic:
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Generative AI models like ChatGPT or Google Gemini can be incredibly helpful for Excel analysis, even though they don't directly integrate into your spreadsheet. You can:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4 pl-5">
          <li className="mb-2">
            **Generate Formulas:** Describe what you want to achieve with your data in plain language (e.g., "Write an Excel formula to sum values in column C only if column A contains 'Sales' and column B is greater than 100"), and the AI will provide the formula.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            **Troubleshoot Formulas:** Paste your formula and describe the problem; the AI can often pinpoint errors or suggest improvements.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            **Explain Concepts:** Ask for explanations of complex Excel functions or data analysis techniques.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            **Suggest Insights:** Copy small, anonymized subsets of your data and ask the AI what trends or anomalies it observes.
